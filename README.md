# AI-Chatbot-For-Facebook-using-RAG-and-NLP
create an AI chatbot that can interact with customers on Facebook. The ideal candidate will have experience in building conversational agents and integrating them with social media platforms. You will be responsible for designing the chatbot's flow, implementing natural language processing (NLP) features, implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and ensuring a seamless user experience. 
------------
Creating an AI chatbot for Facebook that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves integrating multiple components, including the Facebook Messenger platform, a language model (such as OpenAI), and a knowledge base for RAG to fetch relevant information.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how we can create this AI chatbot:
Key Components:

    Facebook Messenger Integration: Use the Facebook Messenger API to receive and send messages to users.
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implement a retrieval mechanism to fetch information from a knowledge base or an external source before generating a response using a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT).
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use NLP models for understanding and processing user messages.
    Backend: A Flask backend to handle the integration of all components.

High-Level Architecture:

    Facebook Messenger API: To interact with users on Facebook.
    NLP and RAG Integration: Use a language model (like GPT from OpenAI) with a retrieval system that fetches data from a knowledge base or an API before generating a response.
    Flask Backend: To handle incoming messages, integrate with the NLP model, perform retrieval, and return a response.

Steps to Implement the AI Chatbot:

    Set up Facebook Messenger Integration:
        You'll need a Facebook Developer Account and a Facebook App to integrate Messenger.
        Set up a Webhook to receive messages and events from Facebook Messenger.

    Build a Flask Backend to interact with Facebook API:
        Use Flask to create a webhook to handle incoming messages and send responses.
        Use the Facebook Graph API to send and receive messages on Facebook.

    Integrate NLP for understanding user input:
        Use an NLP model (such as OpenAI's GPT) to process the incoming message and generate responses.

    Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
        The RAG system should fetch relevant documents or data from an external database or API before generating a response.

Python Code Example:
1. Flask Backend for Facebook Messenger Integration

Install required libraries:

pip install flask requests openai

Here's a basic Flask backend that integrates with Facebook Messenger:

import os
import json
import requests
from flask import Flask, request
import openai

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set OpenAI API key (for NLP and RAG)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Facebook page token (replace with your token)
PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Facebook verify token for webhook verification
VERIFY_TOKEN = "YOUR_FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN"

# Function to send a message to Facebook Messenger
def send_message(recipient_id, message_text):
    url = f"https://graph.facebook.com/v12.0/me/messages?access_token={PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    payload = {
        "recipient": {"id": recipient_id},
        "message": {"text": message_text},
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()

# Function to process user message (with RAG & NLP)
def process_user_message(user_message):
    # Example RAG: fetch relevant information from a knowledge base or external source
    # For now, let's assume we are just sending back the user message after processing
    # Ideally, you would perform a retrieval from an external database or API here
    response_from_retrieval = "Fetched information based on your query: " + user_message

    # Combine RAG with OpenAI model for final response generation
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Use the GPT model
        prompt=f"User asked: {user_message}\nProvide a helpful and friendly response, including fetched information: {response_from_retrieval}",
        max_tokens=150,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Webhook verification (to confirm Facebook's webhook)
@app.route("/webhook", methods=["GET"])
def verify():
    # Verify the token for Facebook to allow the webhook
    if request.args.get("hub.mode") == "subscribe" and request.args.get("hub.challenge"):
        if request.args.get("hub.verify_token") == VERIFY_TOKEN:
            return request.args["hub.challenge"], 200
        else:
            return "Verification token mismatch", 403
    return "Hello, World!", 200

# Webhook to handle incoming messages
@app.route("/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def handle_message():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Iterate through all messages
    for entry in data["entry"]:
        for messaging_event in entry["messaging"]:
            if messaging_event.get("message"):
                sender_id = messaging_event["sender"]["id"]
                user_message = messaging_event["message"].get("text")

                # Process user message and generate response
                if user_message:
                    response_text = process_user_message(user_message)
                    send_message(sender_id, response_text)

    return "OK", 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)

2. Setting Up the Webhook:

    Go to Facebook Developer Console and set up your Messenger Webhook for the Facebook App.
    You need to provide the Webhook URL (for example, https://yourdomain.com/webhook) and the Verify Token for webhook verification.
    Facebook will send a GET request with a challenge to your webhook. The code above responds to this challenge to verify the webhook.

3. Processing User Input with OpenAI:

In the process_user_message function, we:

    Retrieve information (in this case, we simply prepend the user message for demonstration, but you can query a database or API for relevant information).
    Then, we pass the information (along with the user message) to the OpenAI API to generate a more detailed and human-like response using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

For a real RAG setup:

    You would query a knowledge base (like a database or external API) before passing the information to OpenAI's model.
    The AI can then combine this data with natural language understanding and generation.

Deploying the Chatbot:

    Deploy this Flask app on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
    Use ngrok for local development to test your webhook before deployment.
    Ensure your Flask app is publicly accessible to Facebook's webhook.

Additional Enhancements:

    RAG with External Data:
        You could connect the system to a search engine or knowledge base (e.g., Elasticsearch or even external APIs) to provide contextually relevant information for RAG.

    User Intent Recognition:
        Use a more advanced NLP model for better intent recognition and processing (e.g., spaCy or BERT for intent classification).

    Multi-Turn Conversations:
        To maintain state in a conversation (for follow-up questions), you could store the conversation history in a database and pass it to the OpenAI model to maintain context.

Conclusion:

This is a simple implementation of a Facebook Messenger AI chatbot using Python, Flask, OpenAI, and RAG. You can extend this by adding more complex retrieval systems, better NLP techniques, and additional features like sentiment analysis or personalized user interactions based on historical data.
